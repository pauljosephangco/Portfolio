                Hi self! How's your day? I know you went through a lot, and you’re still<br><br> 
            discovering more about yourself. Sorry for always accepting challenges in our life.<br><br>
            Letting people come into our lives that we might know in the end that they will hurt <br><br>
            us..but still you keep on surviving the challenges in order for you to discover<br><br>
            your own worth. I know how hard it is for you and how painful it is to wake<br><br>
            up everyday with a lot of questions on your mind that until now still have no<br><br>
            answer. Honestly, I’m so proud of where you are now. and I know you’re still <br><br>
            struggling, healing in the last relationship you had, that made you believe<br><br>
            that it was perfect and worth fighting for.</p>
                </div>
                    <div class="Second">
                    <p><br>&emsp; &emsp;
                        I know your heart is tired and broken but you still try to <br><br>
                        fix it in order for you to fight and with a little hope that someday, someone<br><br>
                         will give you the answers to your countless questions. Hope that in this <br><br>
                        cruel called life, you are still able to be genuinely happy. With all the<br><br>
                        bruises you have, still praying for you to become stronger. And also may <br><br>
                        you find the true happiness that you are looking for.</p>
                    </div>
                            <div class="Third">
                        <p><br>&emsp; &emsp;I hope you will feel happy that you have followed a path<br><br>
                             that you are proud of, which allows you to understand yourself better. <br><br>
                             Surprise me with what you have in store. And something to remember is <br><br>
                             that it is okay to not know what you want to do in life.</p>
